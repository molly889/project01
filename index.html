    <p>The responsive part was the most difficult for me. I had no idea how to fix the default padding on the right hand side without ruining the left side. After a lot of searching and experimenting, I found out that I had to give the list 0 padding and a 0 auto for the margin. I did not have a firm understanding on responsive design so I found it to be quite difficult.</p>
    <p>The sources helped my project but I did not have a firm grasp on some concepts. I watched many YouTube videos and used other sources such as css-tricks and W3Schools. I really like W3Schools especially because they have a demo of the code as well as the web display. It really helps me understand concepts and see transitions.</p>
    <p>I really enjoyed doing the animations however. I found the tutorial to be very informative and helpful. I do much better learning when I follow visually rather than reading directions. I also searched W3Schools to learn other techniques such as “alternate-reverse”. I would love to have more homework assignment that have tutorials because I feel that I learn new concepts much more effectively.</p>
    <p>I had a lot of trouble with the image sizing when I tried to make it responsive. My pictures are all the same size by default, as I could not figure out how to scale them to fit without ruining the image. I would love to learn how to scale different sizes to fit because I am sure if I work in this industry, I will have to know master it. I am not sure if I did the gridding correctly, I think its something I still need to practice. Another thing I would have changed is maybe making my pictures more spread out. I think having them this close together visually helps group them but, it may be too close. Lastly, with I would also change the sizing of the transform element on when I hover over the image. Overall I still have more to learn but, I feel with more practice and tutorials, I will become stronger in my coding abilities.</p>
